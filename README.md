### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I am an analytics consultant by profession, data science enthusiast by my recently-figured-out-interest and I'm aspiring to be full-time data scientist. 
I am new to GitHub and I'm going full-speed.
Work-wise, I have helped my clients drive business through data-driven insights for more than 3 years now. 
I pride myself in my ability to do stakeholder management and design solutions through data across industries such as Supply Chain, Procurement, and Insurance. 

ðŸŒ± To develop a strong base in data science, I have recently completed *Master's in Business Analytics* from Singapore Management University and now, Iâ€™m seeking to leverage recently acquired strong skillsets in machine learning, deep learning, and Big Data to solve challenging business problems and grow as a data scientist.
I am technically sound in using Python, SQL, Tableau, Advanced-excel and VBA.

âš¡ I love to Jam in musical sessions - I'll play guitar, you can play the rest!
