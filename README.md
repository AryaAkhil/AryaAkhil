### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I am an analytics consulant by profession, data science enthusiast by my recently figured-out-interest and I'm aspiring to be full-time data scientist. 
I am new to GitHub and I'm going full-speed.
Work-wise, I have helped my clients drive business through data-driven insights for more than 3 years now. 
I pride myself in stakeholder management and designing & developing solutions through data across diverse industries â€“ Supply Chain, Procurement, and Insurance. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m seeking to leverage recently acquired strong skillsets in machine learning, deep learning, and Big Data through *Masterâ€™s in Business Analytics* from Singapore Management University to solve challenging business problems and grow in data science.
