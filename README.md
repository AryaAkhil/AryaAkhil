### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I am a Lead Data Scientist by profession.
Work-wise, I have helped my clients drive business through data-driven insights for more than 3 years. 
I pride myself in my ability to do stakeholder management and design solutions through data across industries such as Retail & Media, Supply Chain, Procurement, and Insurance. 

ðŸŒ± I have recently completed *Master's in Business Analytics* from Singapore Management University and Iâ€™m seeking to leverage strengthened skillsets in machine learning, deep learning, and Big Data to solve challenging business problems and grow as a data scientist.
I am technically sound in using Python, SQL, Tableau, Advanced-excel and VBA.
